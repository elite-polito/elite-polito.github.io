# Participation at EICS 2025

From June 23 to June 27, 2025, the e-Lite group will attend the [_17th ACM SIGCHI Symposium on Engineering Interactive Computing Systems (EICS 2025)_](https://eics.acm.org/2025/) in Trier, Germany.

Francesca and Tommaso will attend the conference in person to showcase their latest work on enhancing the workflow for UI designers and developers using AI. Tommaso will present a paper introducing new datasets to train more capable AI models that can automatically generate code from a visual concept. Francesca will present a late-breaking result that introduces a method to translate web data into Figma-compatible designs, allowing the development of AI-powered assistants that integrate directly into designers' creative workflows.

If you see any of us, feel free to say hello: we're always happy to chat! ðŸ˜Š

### Advancing Code Generation from Visual Designs through Transformer-Based Architectures and Specialized Datasets
The paper "_Advancing Code Generation from Visual Designs through Transformer-Based Architectures and Specialized Datasets_" will be presented by Tommaso on **June 26** during **Paper Session 3 - Modelling and Development** at **15:30**.

This paper addresses the limitations of current methods for translating web designs into code, which often rely on simplistic datasets and have not fully explored the potential of transformer-based models. Our contributions include:

1. A web scraping methodology to collect and process a diverse dataset of real-world websites.
2. A synthetic dataset of webpage mockups and their sketched conversions.
3. An evaluation of two recent multimodal transformer architectures on these datasets.

Results on synthetic and sketch-based datasets demonstrate the architectures' potential as effective design-to-code automation solutions, while also identifying remaining challenges in modeling real-world website complexity.

### Bridging Web and Figma: Automating Large-Scale UI Dataset Generation for AI-Enhanced Design
The second paper, "_Bridging Web and Figma: Automating Large-Scale UI Dataset Generation for AI-Enhanced Design_" will also be presented by Francesca on **June 27** during **Paper Session 9 - Design Support** at **13:30** as a **Late-Breaking Result**.

In this work, we introduce an automated pipeline capable of converting any HTML-based user interface into a structured, Figma-compatible JSON representation. This pipeline was applied to WebUI, a large-scale HTML-based dataset, to capture structural and semantic details. 

To validate its effectiveness, five state-of-the-art layout generation models were trained on data generated by our pipeline and compared with models trained on the manually annotated Rico dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that these models achieve comparable performance, suggesting our pipeline can produce high-quality data suitable for training AI models that integrate into design workflows.
