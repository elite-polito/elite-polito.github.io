# Invited Talk at ECAT Research Workshop 2025

On November 12, 2025, Alberto participated as a panellist in the [ECAT Research Workshop 2025](https://algorithmic-transparency.ec.europa.eu/events/ecat-research-workshop-2025-2025-11-12_en), held in Seville, Spain. The workshop was organized by the European Centre for Algorithmic Transparency (ECAT), which provides technical and scientific expertise for the enforcement of the Digital Services Act (DSA).


Alberto participated in the panel discussion "A captive audience? Social media addiction and the features that make it hard for children to leave" alongside Dr Susanne Baumgartner (Assistant Professor, University of Amsterdam) and Dr Elisa Benedetti (Researcher, Laboratory of Epidemiology, Institute of Clinical Physiology, Italian National Research Council). The session was chaired by Dr Astrid Bertrand, Scientific Officer at ECAT.

The panel explored critical questions about social media addiction and the impact of extended digital media use on young people. We discussed how social media compares to other addictions, which platform features can exacerbate addictive behaviours, as well as the types of interventions—by platforms, individuals, or regulation—that may be most effective in preventing tech overuse from taking hold.

Overall, the workshop brought together researchers and policymakers to exchange ideas and explore future collaborations, focusing on systemic risks outlined in Article 34 of the DSA, particularly those affecting the mental and physical health of minors. Featuring keynotes, panel discussions, and poster sessions, it offered a valuable forum for discussing digital wellbeing and deceptive design practices with experts and regulators. The event underscored how research can inform policy and regulatory efforts to protect minors online and highlighted the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration across cognitive development, platform design, addiction research, and policy to tackle these complex challenges.
