**[Andrea Sillano](https://www.polito.it/personale?p=andrea.sillano)** (on the left in the picture above) began his [PhD in Computer and Control Engineering](https://www.polito.it/en/education/phd-programmes-and-postgraduate-school/phd-programmes/computer-and-control-engineering) (41st cycle) in November 2025. He is co-supervised by Luigi De Russis, Raphaël Troncy (EURECOM), and Pasquale Lisena (EURECOM). Andrea's research focuses on human-centred AI, particularly on _enhancing educational storytelling with human-centered AI in the LLM era_.

**[Riccardo Graziosi](https://www.polito.it/en/staff?p=riccardo.graziosi)** (on the right in the picture above) also started his [PhD in Computer and Control Engineering](https://www.polito.it/en/education/phd-programmes-and-postgraduate-school/phd-programmes/computer-and-control-engineering) (41st cycle) in November 2025. He is co-supervised by Alberto Monge Roffarello and Luigi De Russis. Riccardo’s research lies at the intersection of digital wellbeing and human-centred AI.

We are thrilled to have them on board and look forward to their contributions to our research. Welcome, Andrea and Riccardo! 🎉
