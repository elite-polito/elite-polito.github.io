# Best Late Breaking Results Award at EICS 2025

Her paper, titled "_Bridging Web and Figma: Automating Large-Scale UI Dataset Generation for AI-Enhanced Design_," was co-authored with Tommaso Cal√≤ and Luigi De Russis, and marks Francesca's first academic publication.

The work introduces an automated pipeline that converts HTML-based UIs into Figma-compatible representations, enabling the creation of large-scale datasets for training AI-driven design assistants without the need for manual annotation.

Special thanks go to the EICS 2025 organizers and reviewers for this recognition, and to the CINECA consortium for sponsoring Francesca's scholarship.
