# Poster at DAUIN PhD Day 2024

On Wednesday, November 6, 2024, students enrolled in the Ph.D. in Computer and Control Engineering and in the National Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence present and discuss their research activities in the context of the DAUIN PhD Day 2024.

Among them, __Tommaso Calò__ will be available to talk about his research with a poster that summarizes three years of work on _enhancing human-AI interaction_.

The poster, entitled "_From human representations to AI realization: algorithms and tools for creating and refining interactive systems_," outlines Tommaso's contributions across different domains where AI can help transform human representations (like sketches and natural language) into interactive systems, from web development tools to educational interfaces and smart home automation.

The event, now at its 8th edition, is an opportunity to illustrate the Ph.D. programs managed by the Department of Control and Computer Engineering (DAUIN) and disseminate the research activities that are carried out by its members.

The DAUIN PhD Day 2024 will take place at the second floor of DAUIN from 9:30 to 13:00 and it is open to all.
