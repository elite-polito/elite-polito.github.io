# Presentation of "Empowering Users: EUD for Mobile Applications Privacy Management"

On June 26, I presented the work "**Empowering Users: End User Development for Mobile Applications Privacy Management**" at the first [International Workshop on Trusted Computing and Artificial Intelligence applied to Cybersecurity](https://sites.google.com/view/trustedaicybersec2024), held in Paris.

Smartphones have become integral to everyday life, offering numerous benefits but also raising significant privacy and security concerns. Users often face challenges managing app permissions and protecting personal data due to the complexity of existing smartphone operating system settings. Our research addresses these issues by introducing Privacy Manager, a mobile application designed for Android devices that employs an End-User Development (EUD) approach.

Privacy Manager empowers users by providing personalized data protection and privacy security measures through user-friendly interfaces and customizable settings. This application enhances user awareness and control over their data, making privacy management accessible even to non-technical users.

During the presentation, I detailed the development of Privacy Manager and discussed the results of a validation study conducted with 8 participants over a week. The study included an initial questionnaire, a week-long period of real-world application usage, and a final assessment using the System Usability Scale (SUS). The findings demonstrated the usability and effectiveness of Privacy Manager, highlighting its potential to significantly improve mobile privacy management.

The presentation was well-received, sparking engaging discussions on the future of privacy management in mobile applications.
