# Research Stay at Universidade de Lisboa on Diminished Reality for Digital Wellbeing

From September to December 2025, I will be undertaking a **4-month research stay in Lisbon** within the framework of the ERASMUS+ project for PhD students. I will be hosted at the [Human-Computer Interaction Lab (HCI Lab)](https://web.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/augusto.esteves/), Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade de Lisboa, under the supervision of **Professor Augusto Esteves**.

During this period, my work will focus on exploring the use of **Diminished Reality applied to Digital Wellbeing**. Opposed to Augmented Reality, Diminished Reality is a technique that can hide real objects from the user's view as if they are not there. Diminished Reality may be exploited to hide digital distractions for people struggling to stay focused on other tasks. The aim is to investigate how this emerging way of experiencing reality can support people struggling with challenges related to their digital wellbeing.

This experience abroad will enrich me as a researcher. I can share my expertise here in Lisbon and explore new points of view and ways of doing research to bring back to the e-Lite group.
