The "Global MOOC and Online Education Alliance" is an international alliance for exchange and cooperation of higher education institutions, to address digital education challenges and to implement practical policies in local communities and around the world. It is a small and diverse group of 17 world-leading universities and 3 online education platforms from across 14 countries in all 6 continents and speaks 10 different languages, and was initiated by Tsinghua University in 2020.

On December 14-16, the Global MOOC Alliance organized its annual conference, hosted by Politecnico di Milano, under the theme *Reconstruction of Future Universities and Education Driven by Artificial Intelligence*. On December 15, during the Plenary Session, Fulvio Corno gave a short keynote speech about **Studentsâ€™ Digital Twins for open exploration of AI features**, where he outlined a possible strategy for a Technical University such as Politecnico di Torino, to leverage their skills and resources to tackle the continuous evolution of AI tools and solutions, in order to provide innovative services to the education community, by elaborating a concept of an *AI Playground*.
