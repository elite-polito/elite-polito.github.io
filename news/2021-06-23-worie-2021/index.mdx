# Participation at WoRIE 2021

On the 22nd of June, the e-Lite group participated in the [10th International Workshop on the Reliability of Intelligent Environments (WoRIE 2021)](http://www.ugr.es/~worie/2021/), a workshop held within the [17th International Conference on Intelligent Environments (IE 2021)](https://mdx.ac.ae/ie2021).
According to the current COVID-19 situation, IE2021 was not held in person at Middlesex University Dubai, UAE, and was moved entirely online.

During this event, Luca Mannella presented a paper titled: "[*Perception of Security Issues in the Development of Cloud-IoT Systems by a Novice Programmer*](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350976009_Perception_of_Security_Issues_in_the_Development_of_Cloud-IoT_Systems_by_a_Novice_Programmer)".

In this paper, starting from a use case, we analyzed the security of some IoT components of Amazon Web Services (AWS) from a novice programmer's point of view. Even if such a platform could be secure by itself, a novice programmer could do something wrong and leave some possible attack points to a malicious user.
In this study, we also surveyed a small group of novice IoT programmers from an Italian consulting engineering company. Even if we discovered that AWS seems quite robust, we noticed that some common security concepts are often not clear or applied by the novice, leaving the door open to possible issues.
