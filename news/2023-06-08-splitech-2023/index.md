# Participation at SpliTech 2023

From the 20th to the 23th of June, the e-Lite research group will participate to the 8th International Conference on Smart and Sustainable Technologies (**SpliTech 2023**).
The conference will be held in Croatia, in Split, and in Bol (Braƒç island).

On the 21st of June, **Luca Mannella will chair the [Special Session on Cybersecurity and IoT](https://elite.polito.it/news/2023/02/07/cfp-splitech2023-cybersecurity)** within the The International Symposium on Internet of Things.

During the special session, Luca will also **present his last paper**, co-authored with Prof. Fulvio Corno, entitled: "[*A Gateway-based MUD Architecture to Enhance Smart Home Security*](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370609562_A_Gateway-based_MUD_Architecture_to_Enhance_Smart_Home_Security)".

The presented paper proposes an expansion to a standard recently proposed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF): the [Manufacturer Usage Description](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8520.html) (MUD).
The research focuses on empowering an extensible smart home gateway allowing it to create an additional layer of protection for all the connected devices.
Indeed, the proposed architecture allows developers to specify the endpoints their plug-ins need to access. These requirements are then processed to generate a consolidated gateway-level MUD file, ensuring protection for all the non-MUD-enabled devices integrated through appropriate plug-ins.

Two noteworthy aspects of the proposed approach are its transparency for the devices themselves and to being fully compatible with the traditional MUD. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, the research team implemented a proof-of-concept using the widely adopted open-source smart home gateway: [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

After the special session, the slides of the presentation will be available on SlideShare.
