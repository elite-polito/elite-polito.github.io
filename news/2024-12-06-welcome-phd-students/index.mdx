**[Luca Scibetta](https://www.polito.it/en/staff?p=luca.scibetta)** (on the left in the picture above) started his [Ph.D. in Computer and Control Engineering](https://www.polito.it/en/education/phd-programmes-and-postgraduate-school/phd-programmes/computer-and-control-engineering) in the XXXIX cycle, on February 2024. Luca is co-advised by Luigi De Russis and Alberto Monge Roffarello, and will work on topics related to digital wellbeing, specifically focusing on "designing user interfaces that promote digital wellbeing."

**[Francesca Russo](https://www.polito.it/en/staff?p=francesca.russo)** (in the middle of the above picture) started her [Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.polito.it/en/education/phd-programmes-and-postgraduate-school/phd-programmes/artificial-intelligence) in the XL cycle, on November 2024. Francesca is co-advised by Luigi De Russis and Antonio Russo (CINECA), and will work on topics lying at the intersection of human-centered AI and education.

Finally, **[Robert Schwartz](https://www.polito.it/en/staff?p=robert.schwartz)** (on the right in the picture above) started his [Ph.D. in Computer and Control Engineering](https://www.polito.it/en/education/phd-programmes-and-postgraduate-school/phd-programmes/computer-and-control-engineering) in the XL cycle, on November 2024. Rob is co-advised by Alberto Monge Roffarello and Luigi De Russis, and will work on topics related to digital wellbeing, specifically focusing on "Digital Wellbeing in Non-Leisure Contexts."

We are excited to have them on board and look forward to their contributions to our research. Welcome, Luca, Francesca, and Rob! ðŸŽ‰
