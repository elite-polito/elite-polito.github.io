DIGI-Teens is a [CHItaly 2025](https://chitaly2025.di.unisa.it/) workshop that aims to establish a venue for the academic and industrial communities to discuss ongoing research and ideas at the intersection of digital wellbeing and education, aiming to promote the development of strategies and tools to "teach" users – particularly children and teenagers – to use technology more meaningfully and consciously.
