# 2nd AccessCoVE Project Meeting

On July 15 and 16, the partners of the AccessCoVE project met for the 2nd plenary meeting of the project 
(following the kick-off meeting in Thessaloniki in September 2023, and many on-line meetings).

The partners were hosted for two very dense days in the Ciminiera Meeting Room at the Department of Control 
and Computer Engineering, in Politecnico di Torino. The partners revised the different Workpackages and pending
activities, and planned a significant number of activities for the next Autumn.
