# Participation at L@S 2025

On July 21-23, 2025, the e-Lite group will attend the [_12th Learning @ Scale Conference (L@S 2025)_](https://learningatscale.acm.org/las2025/) in Palermo, Italy.

Francesca Russo will present her latest publication "Towards Step-Aware ITSs: Generation and Evaluation of Synthetic Step-by-Step Exercise Solutions" on Tuesday, July 22 during the poster session from 16:00 to 17:30.

The paper addresses a specific gap in how current Intelligent Tutoring Systems’ (ITSs) work: they propose sequences of exercises to learners solely relying on previous whole-exercise feedback, rather than the feedback from smaller sub-problems, which may unveil specific learning difficulties. 

To close the gap, the work employs GPT-o3-mini to generate step-by-step solutions for mathematics exercises from the Junyi Academy dataset. Then, three models of varying size from the Llama family, simulating students of different knowledge levels, receive the additional step-by-step guidance to verify if it can improve their problem-solving capabilities. The Llama models successfully solve up to 42% more exercises when provided with an incremental step guidance strategy, compared to direct answers.

Such initial results hint that it’s possible and effective to think of next-generation step-aware ITSs tailored to students’ specific knowledge gaps.
