# Presentation of "Defining and Identifying Attention Capture Damaging Patterns in Digital Interfaces" at ACM CHI 2023

On April 26, 2023, Alberto presented the paper "_Defining and Identifying Attention Capture Damaging Patterns in Digital Interfaces_" in the "Digital Wellbeing" session at ACM CHI 2023, the premier international conference of Human-Computer Interaction. 

The work is a collaboration between the e-Lite group and the [Human-Computer Interaction Lab](https://kailukoff.com) at Santa Clara University, CA (USA). It defines and proposes a typology of recurring patterns in digital interfaces that designers use to capture users' attention and maximize advertisement revenue. These **attention-capture damaging patterns**, exploit people's psychological vulnerabilitiesm, often leading the user to lose track of their goals, lose their sense of time and control, and later feel regret. The figure, for example, shows the **neverending autoplay** pattern on YouTube: when the current video ends, the platform automatically plays a new recommeded video by default.

We see our typology as a promising starting point to establish new procedures for evaluating existing interfaces and support designers in adopting patterns that preserve and respect the users' attention. Furthermore, we hope that our work will give rise to new regulations and policies, something that is already happening for dark patterns that lead to financial and privacy harms. We also created a website - [attentioncapture.com](http://attentioncapture.com) - to increase the reach of our work among the public and design professionals.
