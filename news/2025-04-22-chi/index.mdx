# Participation at CHI 2025

From April 26 to May 1, 2025, the e-Lite group will attend the [_ACM CHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems_](https://chi2025.acm.org) in Yokohama, Japan.

Luigi, Alberto, Tommaso, Luca, and Rob will be there in person. If you see any of us, feel free to say hello: we're always happy to chat! ðŸ˜Š

The team will present a full paper on scientific writing with AI, along with two Late-Breaking Works (LBWs) on digital wellbeing.

### Investigating How Computer Science Researchers Design Their Co-Writing Experiences With AI
The paper "_Investigating How Computer Science Researchers Design Their Co-Writing Experiences With AI_" will be presented by Tommaso on Tuesday, **April 29** at 11:10 (session: Writing Support and Content Moderation). 

In the paper, we conducted observations and retrospective interviews with 19 computer science researchers to explore how they collaborate with intelligent writing assistants on their ongoing projects, adopting a design-in-use perspective.
Our findings highlight issues such as workflow disruptions and over-reliance on AI, and reveal *five design-in-use styles* &mdash; teaching, resisting, repurposing, orchestrating, and complying &mdash; each encompassing distinct practices used by researchers.

### Bridging Digital Wellbeing and Accessibility: An Analysis of the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
The first Late-Breaking Work, "_Bridging Digital Wellbeing and Accessibility: An Analysis of the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines_" will be discussed by Rob during the April 30 LBW sessions.

This paper investigates the intersection and potential synergies between the WCAG guidelines and digital wellbeing research. We used an expert coding method to classify all requirements from the main WCAG versions (1.0, 2.2, and 3.0 draft) in terms of their secondary effects on digital wellbeing and attention-capture dark patterns. 
Our analysis shows that an increasing number of WCAG requirements support digital wellbeing, although in some cases their influence may be merely enabling, limited, or even negative.

### Towards Digital Well-being Education in High-School
The second Late-Breaking Work, "_Towards Digital Well-being Education in High-School_" will also be presented during the April 30 LBW sessions. This work stems from a collaboration with the University of Bologna under a national PRIN 2022 project and will be presented by Luca.

The paper showcases our progress so far, focusing on how educational interventions can shape teens' digital habits. We conducted four co-design sessions with 74 high school students and collected responses from 18 teachers via online questionnaires.
By analyzing preferences from both students and educators, we developed innovative, acceptable strategies for addressing digital wellbeing challenges. Based on our findings, we propose seven guidelines on modalities and approaches to improve the design of educational applications for digital well-being.
