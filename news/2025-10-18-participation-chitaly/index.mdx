# Participation at CHItaly 2025

Last week, on October 8-10, 2025, the e-Lite group has attended (in person) the [_16th Biannual Conference of the Italian SIGCHI Chapter_](https://chitaly2025.di.unisa.it/) (CHItaly 2025) in Salerno, Italy.

Luca, Francesca, and Luigi attended the entire conference and particularly the Doctoral Consortium session during which both Luca and Francesca presented their works recieving feedback and precious suggestions from experts and peers.

Luca presented "Novel Interactive Systems Promoting More Intentional Technology Use", joining and linking the works he has done during his first year and half of PhD along with the future works that will follow them.

Francesca presented "Supporting, not Solving: Human-Centered AI Systems in Education", where she shared her initial works explored during her first year of PhD followed by many ideas of new possible directions to undergo.

Under the frame of designing novel systems that can improve the digital wellbeing of people, considering the different targets and contexts, Luca presented his previous research about the integration of AI and LLMs in tools for supporting people's digital wellbeing and the DIGI-Teens App for digital wellbeing education in schools. He followed by sharing his current and future research project, ranging from practical implementation and long in-the-wild testing of AI-powered application for digital wellbeing, to more gamified education and the exploration of diminished reality in this field.

Francesca presented the work completed in her first year. She began by presenting a pipeline that automatically converts HTML data into Figma representations to build large-scale datasets without human annotations. She then described a study in which she simulated three students with different knowledge levels using LLMs. She concluded with future directions of her research in Human-Centered AI for education including AI tools to support teachers for exam grading and the use of multimodal technologies to enable more inclusive and interactive learning experiences.
