The paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Bing, ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude.AI,
to act as "digital wellbeing assistants" and help users manage problematic smartphone use and improve digital wellbeing. Unlike traditional digital self-control methods,
these AI chatbots can provide personalized suggestions to address issues like overuse and possible solutions, tailored to individual needs.
The research developed four user personas based on the existing literature and representing a different type of negative smartphone usage pattern to test the effectiveness of these
LLMs in understanding and responding to various smartphone use problems, providing suitable and diversified solutions. 
The findings suggest that LLMs could lead to smarter, AI-driven strategies for enhancing digital self-control and supporting users' self-monitoring and regulation.
