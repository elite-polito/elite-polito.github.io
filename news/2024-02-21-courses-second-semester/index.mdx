# Courses by the e-Lite group (II semester 2023/2024)

On March 4, 2024, Politecnico di Torino's students will start the __second semester__ for this academic year, after the exam session.

Members of the e-Lite group teach one elective and three mandatory courses. Such courses are offered in different bachelors' and masters' degrees. Courses' topics include web applications, programming techniques, and digital wellbeing.

## Elective Courses
This coming semester, members of the e-Lite group are involved in one elective course: _Benessere Digitale_ (B.S. in Engineering, in Italian).


### Benessere Digitale
_Alberto Monge Roffarello_ teaches the __Benessere Digitale__ (Digital Wellbeing) course, together with _Monica Molino_ from the Psychology Department of University of Torino.

The course, among the 3rd year's "Grandi Sfide" of the Engineering bachelor's degrees, covers the basic concepts around digital wellbeing. Using human-computer interaction and psychology instruments, such as journey maps and interviews, it also accompanies students in creating a prototype of a digital wellbeing tool.

Interested people can find the course materials under [Teaching > Benessere Digitale (01DEL)](/teaching/01del-benesseredigitale) and the [official course description](https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/gap.pkg_guide.viewGap?p_cod_ins=01DELMQ) in the students' guide. The course is offered in Italian.

## Mandatory Courses
Members of the e-Lite group are involved in three mandatory courses in the second semester: _Applicazioni Web I_ (M.S. in Computer Engineering, in Italian), _Web Applications I_ (M.S. in Computer Engineering, in English) and _Tecniche di Programmazione_ (B.S. in Engineering and Management, in Italian).

### Applicazioni Web I/Web Applications I
__Applicazioni Web I__ and __Web Applications I__ are the same course offered in two different languages: Italian and English. The course is _mandatory_ for 1st-year students enrolled in the master's degree in Computer Engineering, and students can choose one of the two.

The course cover the main concepts and technologies of modern web applications, including JavaScript programming and the React library.

The Italian version of the course is taught by _Luigi De Russis_ and _Luca Mannella_. 
Course materials are available on this same website, under [Teaching > Applicazioni Web I (01UDF)](/teaching/01udf-aw1). The course description is available in the [official students' guide](https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/gap.pkg_guide.viewGap?p_cod_ins=01UDFOV).

The English version, instead, is held by _Fulvio Corno_, _Juan Pablo SÃ¡enz Moreno_, and _Luca Pezzolla_. Similarly, course materials are available on this same website, under [Teaching > Web Applications I (01TXY)](/teaching/01txy-wa1). The course description, finally, is available in the [official students' guide](https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/gap.pkg_guide.viewGap?p_cod_ins=01TXYOV).
The English course is also offered as a choice to students in the master's degree on Data Science Engineering.


### Tecniche di Programmazione
_Fulvio Corno_, to conclude, is the main teacher of the __Tecniche di Programmazione__ (Programming Techniques) course, offered in Italian to bachelor's degree students in their third year of Management and Engineering. 

The course introduces the main topics and concepts related to algorithms and programming techniques, as the name suggests. For the first time this semester, the course will adopt Python as language (instead of Java).
As before, course materials are available on this website under [Teaching > Tecniche di Programmazione (03FYZ)](/teaching/past-courses/2024-03fyz-tdp). The students' guide includes the official [course description](https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/gap.pkg_guide.viewGap?p_cod_ins=03FYZPL).
