The school brought together students and experts from around the Mediterranean sea and the world, offering a rich program of talks and activities.

The lectures were delivered by leading researchers in the field of HCI and provided deep insights and inspiration. Just as valuable was the chance to engage with fellow students exchanging ideas, sharing experiences, and forming new research connections.

Group activities encouraged collaboration across different backgrounds and perspectives, making the experience not only intellectually stimulating but also deeply rewarding on a personal level.

The beautiful location and welcoming atmosphere added a special touch to an already outstanding week of learning and networking. Iâ€™m grateful for the experience and excited to bring back fresh ideas and inspiration to our research group.
