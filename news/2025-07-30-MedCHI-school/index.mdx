# Participation in the Summer School "Designing Human-centric Interactive and Intelligent Technology" organised by MedCHI

From July 21 to 25, 2025, I have attended the [ACM SIGCHI MedCHI Summer School on "Designing Human-centric Interactive and Intelligent Technology"](https://dhit.lakecomoschool.org/) in Como, Italy.

This summer school brought together students and experts from across the Mediterranean region and beyond, offering an enriching program of lectures, hands-on sessions, and collaborative activities focused on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and AI-enhanced systems.

The lectures covered a wide range of themes, from AI-enhanced interaction to cultural heritage and post-human design, delivered by outstanding researchers including Shaimaa Lazem, Valentina Nisi, Heloisa Candello, Catia Prandi, Nuno Nunes, Tsvi Kuflik, Shlomo Berkovsky, and Stephen Brewster. Their talks provided valuable insights and inspiration, sparking rich discussions and serving as a foundation for our collaborative group work.

One of the most engaging aspects of the school was the opportunity to collaborate with fellow students during the group project sessions. I really enjoyed working in a diverse team, where we brainstormed and developed our own concept for a future research project inspired by the themes of the school and the lectures we attended. The group work was a valuable space for creative exchange and learning from each other's backgrounds and perspectives.

The beautiful location and the welcoming atmosphere at "Villa del Grumello" with the sight of Como lake truly elevated the week, making it not only intellectually stimulating but also deeply rewarding on a personal level. I'm grateful for this opportunity and excited to bring fresh inspiration and new ideas back to our research group.
