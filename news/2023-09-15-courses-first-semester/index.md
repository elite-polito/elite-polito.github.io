# Courses by the e-Lite group (I semester 2023/2024)

On October 2, 2023, Politecnico di Torino's students will start the first semester in the new __academic year__. Welcome back!

Members of the e-Lite group teach various courses in the semester, some of them being elective. Such courses are offered in different bachelors' and masters' degrees. Courses' topics include web applications, databases, and human-computer interaction. 

We invite students to familiarize themselves with the courses taught by group members and consider them for their choices. Continue to read for more details and useful links.

## Elective Courses
This coming semester, members of the e-Lite group are involved in three elective courses: _Human Computer Interaction_ (M.S. in Computer Engineering, in English); _Introduzione alle Applicazioni Web_ (B.S. in Engineering, in Italian); and _User Experience Design_ (M.S. in Cinema and Media Engineering, in Italian).

### Human Computer Interaction
__Human Computer Interaction__ see the participation of three members of the group: _Luigi De Russis_ (main teacher), _Alberto Monge Roffarello_, and _Tommaso Calò_. 

The course, elective for the master's degree in Computer Engineering and held in English, provides a solid foundation for the field. It gives students hands-on practice to design and develop innovative solutions by adopting a modern human-centered process while building a prototype application to serve target users. In the end, students will learn how to design and create usable, useful, and used technologies.

Course materials are available on this same website, under [Teaching > Human Computer Interaction (01JSK)](/teaching/02jsk-hci), while the full [course description](https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/gap.pkg_guide.viewGap?p_cod_ins=02JSKOV) is on the students' guide.

### Introduzione alle Applicazioni Web
_Luigi De Russis_ and _Juan Pablo Sáenz Moreno_ teach the __Introduzione alle Applicazioni Web__ (Introduction to Web Applications) course.

The course, among the 3rd year's "free credits" of the Engineering bachelor's degrees, covers the basic concepts and technologies of the Web. Using Python and the Flask framework, it also accompanies students in building a complete web application.

Interested people can find the course materials under [Teaching > Introduzione alle Applicazioni Web (01DXU)](teaching/01dxu-iaw) and the [official course description](https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/gap.pkg_guide.viewGap?p_cod_ins=01DXU) in the students' guide. The course is offered in Italian.

### User Experience Design
_Alberto Monge Roffarello_ is the main teacher of __User Experience Design__, a new elective course for the master's degree in Cinema and Media Engineering. 

The course, held in Italian and with the participation of two psychologists from the University of Torino, shares the same goal of the previous Human Computer Interaction course but orient it to serve better the different degree program in which it is offered.

Course materials will be available on this website under [Teaching](/teaching). As before, the official [course description](https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/gap.pkg_guide.viewGap?p_cod_ins=01HFXPD) is in the students' guide.

## Mandatory Courses
Members of the e-Lite group are involved in two mandatory courses in the first semester: _Informatica_ (B.S. in Engineering) and _Basi di dati_ (B.S. in Cinema and Media Engineering). Both courses are in Italian.

### Informatica
_Fulvio Corno_ is one of the main teachers of the __Informatica__ (Computer Science) course. The course, held in Italian, is _mandatory for all 1st-year students enrolled in bachelor's degrees in Engineering. 

It covers the basis of Computer Science and introduces programming in Python. Course materials are available on this same website, under [Teaching > Informatica (14BHD)](teaching/14bhd-informatica). The course description, instead, is available in the [official students' guide](https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/gap.pkg_guide.viewGap?p_cod_ins=14BHDNX).

### Basi di Dati
_Laura Farinetti_, finally, is the main teacher of the __Basi di dati__ (Databases) course, offered in Italian to bachelor's degree students in Cinema and Media Engineering. 

The course introduces the main topics and concepts related to database technologies and languages. As before, course materials are available on this website under [Teaching > Basi di Dati (04AFQPC)](teaching/04afqpc-bdcin). The students' guide includes the official [course description](https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/gap.pkg_guide.viewGap?p_cod_ins=04AFQPC).
