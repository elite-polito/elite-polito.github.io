The paper explores the idea of having designers prioritizing users' digital wellbeing during the design stage, instead of having end-users handling on external tools.

Indeed, user interfaces heavily rely on attention-capture design patterns, e.g., infinite scroll and other variable-rewarding mechanisms, that erode users' sense of autonomy and undermine their digital wellbeing. Instead of having users rely on external self-regulation tools, we advocate that tech companies and designers should prioritize users' digital wellbeing by design. 

To take a first step in this direction, the paper presents **Digital Wellbeing Lens**, a Figma plugin that guides designers in creating user interfaces that _respect and preserve user time and attention_. The plugin allows the continuous evaluation of prototypes against attention-capture patterns, calculating a digital wellbeing score and suggesting suitable design alternatives. 

Besides introducing the plugin, we demonstrate its practical application through a use case involving the design of a mobile social media app, and we report on the results of a first exploratory study with four designers, discussing the opportunities and challenges of embracing this paradigm shift.
