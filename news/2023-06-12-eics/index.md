# Participation at EICS 2023 

From June 26-30, 2023, the e-Lite group will participate (in person) in the [_15th ACM SIGCHI Symposium on Engineering Interactive Computing Systems_](https://eics.acm.org/2023/index.php) (EICS 2023) in Swansea, United Kingdom.

Juan Pablo Saenz and Tommaso Calò will each present a paper, while Tommaso will also discuss his doctoral research during the Doctoral Consortium.

The first paper introduces **an innovative conversational agent** that captures a developer's reasoning and motivations during the coding process. The second paper, on the other hand, presents **a visual programming tool** enabling the **design, training, and evaluation of deep learning models** without the need for specific programming languages. Tommaso Calò's Doctoral Consortium research discusses **how AI can bring changes to human experiences during design and creative processes**.

### Listen Veronica! Can You Give me a Hand With This Bug?

Juan Pablo will present the paper "_Listen Veronica! Can You Give me a Hand With This Bug?_" on on Wednesday, *28 June** at 11:30.

This paper introduces Veronica, a conversational agent integrated directly into Visual Studio Code. Veronica is designed to capture a developer's reasoning and motivations, recording memos and linking them with the code they are writing. Furthermore, Veronica can interact with the web browser to automatically gather the sources consulted by the developer and attach them to the code. A usability study with 8 participants validates this approach, with the participants positively assessing the tool's usefulness.

### Towards A Visual Programming Tool to Create Deep Learning Models
The paper, "_Towards A Visual Programming Tool to Create Deep Learning Models_" will be presented by Tommaso on Wednesday, **28 June** at 12:00.

The paper presents DeepBlocks, a visual programming tool that allows deep learning developers from various backgrounds to design, train, and evaluate models without having to use specific programming languages. DeepBlocks was created based on a series of formative interviews with 5 participants, and was validated through a typical use case. The results demonstrate that developers can use DeepBlocks to visually design complex deep learning architectures.

## Doctoral Consortium: Human-Centered AI for Creative Design
Tommaso Calò will also participate in the Doctoral Consortium with his research titled "_Human-Centered AI for Creative Design_" where he explores the opportunities for AI to bring radical changes in human experiences during the design and creative processes, assist designers' creative ability, and provide new approaches to augment design cognition. Tommaso will present his research on Monday, **30 June** at 12:00.
