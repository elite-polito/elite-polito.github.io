## Course Organization

Teachers: Alberto Monge Roffarello.

The course will be held _primarly_ in person, with video-recorded lectures and the possibility of virtual attendance during some exercises (see the Introduction slides).

Students are encouraged to attend the classes with their laptops.

## Course Topics
Over the past decade, public discourse and research have increasingly focused on the challenges stemming from pervasive and excessive technology use, particularly in AI-driven platforms such as social networks. These challenges are often amplified by specific design patterns embedded in modern user interfaces, which leverage AI techniques to capture and retain user attention. This course equips students with both practical and theoretical tools to analyze the impact of persuasive and opaque technologies on user wellbeing and to design systems that foster agency, transparency, and meaningful engagement.

* Fundamentals on persuasive technology and the Attention Economy
* Theories in Digital Wellbeing research
* Perspectives in Digital Wellbeing research
  * Supporting end-users' self regulation
  * Designing technolgies that promote Digital Wellbeing
  * Regulating the Digital Wellbeing
* Guidelines and methods to evaluate Digital Wellbeing in a user interface 
* Hands-on session: prototyping Digital Wellbeing supports

## Exam
The exam will consist in the evaluation of three exercises proposed and developed during the class hours.

A successful completion of the final exercise and _at least_ one of the other two are needed to pass the exam.
