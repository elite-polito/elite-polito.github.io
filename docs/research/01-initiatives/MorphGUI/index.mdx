MorphGUI is a **framework** that leverages Large Language Models to enable users to customize interfaces using **natural language** without altering the application's **core functionalities**.
Its structured dual-input design separates **functional goals** ("what it should do") from **visual specifications** ("how it should appear"), allowing users to modify interface elements while maintaining the integrity of the underlying system logic. Powered by a **dynamic component** architecture, MorphGUI applies updates at runtime, preserving both the application state and baseline functionality.

## Customization Interface

The "Enhance With AI" panel in MorphGUI enables users to personalize and modify their interface through AI-assisted customization. It features two main sections, **Static Settings** and **Dynamic Settings**, allowing configuration of both fixed and adaptive interface components. 
Within the **Dynamic Settings** tab, the **Personalize** section introduces **component-level targeting** for modifying or adding UI elements. 
Users specify *What it should do* to define the element's functional behavior and *How it should appear* to control its styling and layout.
The panel also provides three main actions: *Generate* to apply the defined changes, *Previous* to roll back to a previous configuration, and *Restore* to return the interface to its last stable state.
