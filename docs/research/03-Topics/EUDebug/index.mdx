Nowadays, end users who want to personalize their **Internet of Things** (IoT) ecosystem can take advantage of
visual programming platforms such as [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/discover) or [Zapier](https://zapier.com/). In such
**End-User Development** (EUD) platforms, users can program
the joint behavior of their devices and online services by defining **trigger-action** rules such as "_if the Nest
camera in the kitchen detects a movement,then send me a Telegram message_." Trigger-action programming is, however, a complex task
for non-programmers, and errors made during the composition of rules may lead to unpredictable behaviors and security
issues, e.g., a lamp that is continuously flashing or a door that is unexpectedly unlocked. As a consequence, one of the
most important and urgent challenges in this context is the need to avoid possible conflicts and to assess the
correctness of trigger-action rules. For this purpose, we introduce **EUDebug**, a system that enables end users to
debug their trigger-action rules.

The goal of **EUDebug** is to properly warn users when they are defining any troublesome or potentially dangerous
behavior, according to two strategies:

1. by assisting them in identifying rule conflicts, and
2. by helping them foresee the run-time behavior of their rules through step-by-step simulation.

The figure below shows a sample usage scenario.

1. The user composes a new trigger-action rule in a web-based application modeled after IFTTT (e.g., "_if the security
   camera in the office is armed, then unlock the door_"). As the user is composing the rule, EUDebug employs a novel
   hybrid Semantic Colored Petri Net to model, check, and simulate the rule with respect to previously defined trigger-action
   rules.
2. When the rule composition is completed, EUDebug highlights possible problems that the rule may generate, by providing
   a short explanation to the user.
3. If needed, the user can further inspect and understand the problems by asking EUDebug to perform and show a
   step-by-step simulation of the problematic rules.
4. Finally, the user can edit the composed rule or decide to ignore the highlighted problems, thus saving the rule in
   the current format.

Thanks to the Semantic Colored Petri Net, EUDebug is able to detect problems in rules that involve different types of
devices but with similar functions. The adopted semantic representation is [EUPont], a high-level semantic model for EUD
in the IoT. It allows the net to reason about the final goal of each object (e.g., illumination, messaging, ...) to
detect and show problems like loops, inconsistencies, and redundancies.
