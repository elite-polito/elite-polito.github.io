AccessCoVE aims to structure excellence in Vocational Education and Training in the field of Accessibility.
Twenty-five partners from four different countries (Greece, Sweden, Spain, and Italy) joined their forces to
establish a European multi-level innovative and constantly growing Centre of Vocational Excellence - the
AccessCoVE - in the field of accessibility for individuals with disabilities (i.e. individuals with impairments and
elders). Through the development of the most up-to-date, valid and worth trusting source for accessibility issues,
AccessCoVE will constitute a key contributor to policy making regarding inclusion in society and accessible
digitalisation. In essence, accessibility will be approached holistically starting from researching the end-usersâ€™
requirements and continuing to the research of stakeholdersâ€™ needs and priorities concerning accessibility issues.
The data collected will form the VET programmes and curricula that will lead to the training frame and the
certification of two new specialties - the Accessibility Certifier and the Accessibility Consultant. Additionally,
AccessCoVEâ€™s activities target the up-skilling and reskilling of specific groups, as well as of students in secondary
and tertiary education. 

AccessCoVE focus thoroughly on excellence which arises from a) innovative VET programmes with respective
teaching and learning activities and tools, b) new specialties that will open new job opportunities while covering
the needs that already put pressure on the business sector, c) constant horizontal and vertical cooperation
between the VET providers, companies, chambers, federations, HEIs, and regional authorities form the very first
moment of the project, d) radical dissemination activities that feed e) a robust sustainability multi-faceted system,
which in combination with f) meticulously designed long-term governance and funding plans, will gradually
transform AccessCoVE into a transnational platform of CoVE.
