# Critical Making

## Critical Making - Addressing Misinformation in STEM Through Makerspaces

The objective of the project is the design and evaluation of curricula and recommendations for teacher trainings targeted
to equip in- and pre-service teachers with the necessary competences and methodological skills to tackle disinformation
and to thus foster studentsâ€™ digital competencies in STEM. In line with the Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027, the
innovative concept features a project-based learning (PBL) approach in pedagogical makerspaces, offering the potential
to challenge disinformation and to cover digital competencies in science contexts in a comprehensive and practical way,
through making and usage of innovative digital technologies and tools. Thematically, sustainable development is focused
across all areas.

The approach is guided by the DigCompEdu and a corresponding competence model, extended for specific aspects of
disinformation and critical thinking (incl. self-assessment through an extension of SELFIEforTeachers).
In close collaboration with STEM experts and regional stakeholders regarding teachersâ€™ continuous professional
development, curricula and trainings will be developed and evaluated, involving at least 100 STEM teachers in each
of the 4 partner countries. Dissemination, also at policy level, will be targeted in 6 countries. The following results are
expected:

- A general framework and good practice examples for PBL activities in pedagogical makerspaces to tackle disinformation and foster digital competences in teacher training activities, integrated in STEM subject fields.
- Assessment of learning impact of designed measures.
- Guidelines and policy suggestions for implementation of corresponding teacher training in different European education systems.
- Self-learning material in terms of OER designed to support PBL activities in pedagogical makerspaces, covering specifically approaches to tackle disinformation.
- A portal for exchanging knowledge and experiences of the designed and evaluated concepts and measures.
